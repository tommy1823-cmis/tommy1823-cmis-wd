					Description and Requirements of Lists and Links
				</h2>
				<p>
					In this assignment, we learnt about creaing lists and 						inserting links. There are two types of lists. Ordered and 						unordered. We also learnt how to add links in the nav section.
					We created an ordered lists of instructions on how to create a 
					webpage on the on the production server, then we made an 
					unordered list of links in the nav section.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Create a new folder called "listsandlinks" in your 							repository folder.
					</li>
					<li>
						Inside listsandlinks create a file called "index.html" and a file 							called "main.css"
					</li>
					<li>
						In index.html create an ordered list of step by step instructions to 							create a new webpage on the production server.
					</li>
					<li>
						Also create an unordered list of 5 or more links to websites with 							useful webdesign related information.
					</li>
					<li>
						In the nav section, create an unordered list of links with a link 							back to your main index page.
					</li>
					<li>
						In your main index.html file in public_html, add an unordered list 							of links to the nav section with a link to "listsandlinks".
					</li>
					<li>
						Add an article with a heading and a paragraph description of this 							assignment. Also add an unordered list that contains this list of 							requirements.
